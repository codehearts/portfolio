In 2012 I was elected webmaster for <abbr title="Computer Interest Floor">CIF</abbr>, a group of individuals who host seminars and provide tech support for the university community, amongst other things. I decided that CIF needed a new face for itself online and began redesigning the site over the summer after my freshman year

I started by inventorying their content to understand what purposes the site serves, and then decided which content is unnecessary. Once that was done, I started work on a design that could be used for everything from the main site to their account management system and any future projects. Their public site was moved to WordPress, which I tweaked to be more friendly to future editors who may not be very tech-savvy. I then refactored all of the old active directory integration code to make it more efficient, more secure, and easier for future members to develop with

I'm hoping that this laid the groundwork for future CIF members to add new features rather than fixing old problems
