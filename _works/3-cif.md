While attending the University of Rochester, I served as webmaster and tech maintenance director for the Computer Interest Floor. I started with a redesign of the <abbr title="Computer Interest Floor">CIF</abbr> website, inventorying the existing site to create a design that was reusable across services and maintainable for non-technical individuals

Other projects included Linux server maintenance, refactoring a PHP-based user control panel with unit tests, and rewriting a C firmware project with full documentation and simulated integration tests. i also gave talks to the university community on Linux, Git, <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>, and using OpenGL with Python
