Kejt is a multimedia blog for posting my creative works. It also serves as a playground for me to experiment with new web technologies

Like most of my side projects, it serves as a safe place to experiment and try new things. While Kejt does make use of newer technology like html5 audio, it degrades gracefully in less capable browsers
