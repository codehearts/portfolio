Mood & Figure is a collection of inspiration I’ve found over the years

The site is an image blog that subtly uses colors taken from each entry, and always links back to the original artists if possible. There’s also tag-based search that allows for excluding certain tags and including multiple tags

Mood & Figure also adapts to smaller screen sizes, and loads all images adaptively to prevent mobile visitors from downloading more data than necessary
